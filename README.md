**Your AI Mental Wellness Friend** – built at HACKTU 6.0

## 🧠 Problem We Solved
Many people suffering from mental stress, loneliness, or anxiety don't feel safe or comfortable sharing with real people. They fear judgment or lack access to therapy. We wanted to build a space where:

- Users can **talk to an AI homie** anytime
- Reflect and build healthy habits (journaling, games, meditation)
- Feel less alone in a homely, gamified environment
